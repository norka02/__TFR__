# TFR
Project created using Python with PyGame ... (in progress)

## About
TFR - Try Fail Repeat <br /><br />
Our goal is to create a program where the car will try to overcome the given track. Each time the car hits the wall, it comes to start and try again. <br />
We intend to create an interface that will show the operation of the heuristic algorithm. We hope to create a game in which the user will compete with our program. <br />
