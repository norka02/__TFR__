Project created using Python with PyGame based on Heuristic Algorithms.

## About
TFR - Try Fail Repeat <br /><br />
Our goal is to create a program where the car will try to overcome the given track. Each time the car hits the wall, it comes to start and try again. <br />
We intend to create an interface that will show the operation of the heuristic algorithm. We hope to create a game in which the user will compete with our program. <br />

## Created things over time: <br />
17.04 - so far we have made a prototype of the first track and the movement of the car <br />
21.04 - colission detection <br />
22.04 - prototype of the menu <br />
06.05 - refractor the code and add finish line functionality <br />
15.05 - fixing and correction small bugs <br />
16.05 - finishing project <br />
